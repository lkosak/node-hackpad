#Overview
A client library for the Hackpad API (Version 1.0)

Make sure to check out the official [Hackpad API documentation](https://hackpad.com/Hackpad-API-v1.0-k9bpcEeOo2Q).

#Requirements

[oauth-client](https://github.com/unscene/node-oauth)

[underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)

(Sorry about the underscore req. It's just for an object merge, and I'll definitely
accept a pull request that eliminates the need for it).

#Installation
Clone from here, or install with npm:

    npm install hackpad

Include in your app:

    var Hackpad = require('hackpad');

#Usage

Instantiate the client with your Hackpad Oauth client ID and secret (You can find them on your [account page](https://hackpad.com/ep/account/)).

    var client = new Hackpad(client_id, secret, [options]);

Then, just run commands on your fancy new client:

    client.create("This is an awesome hackpad");

All methods accept a [callback] function in the usual format:

    client.create("I like this hackpad even more", function(err, result) {
      if(err) { return console.log("Oh crap!"); }
      // do something...
    });

JSON responses are parsed automatically for you, so this would work:

    client.create("I should stop creating new hackpads", function(err, resp) {
      console.log(resp.padId);
    });

For non-JSON responses (just `export` at this point), the raw body is returned.

## Options

An optional options dictionary can be passed to the client.

`site` custom site (e.g., "mycompany" if your Hackpad site is mycompany.hackpad.com)
